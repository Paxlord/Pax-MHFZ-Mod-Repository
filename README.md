# Pax-MHFZ-Mod-Repository
Repository for all of my MHFZ mods. All of the mods here can be considered experimental and you might have some issues with them. Feel free to report any bugs or features suggestions in this repo or shoot me a discord DM at @pax_777.

## Installing
All of the mods in this repository work with my mod loader that can be found here : https://github.com/Paxlord/Pax-Mhfz-Loader
Once you have the loader installed you can simply download the DLL you want and drop it in the "mods" folder inside the game's folder.

# Mods

## Weapon Unbloater
Unbloat raw and elemental value for all weapons, also displays your true raw instead of the bloated one. 
Bloating can be toggled on or off in the mod menu. 

## Box Swap
Swap all of the boxes with the one you can find at the smithy or in your house that allows you to change your equipment everywhere. Due to some issues with cuffs, you can't change equipment while you have a quest up.
